# Jammer_And_Dart
Jammer Oscillator and Dart Glider

For the time being, they are using two different cmds.
<br/><br/>

For the Jammer Oscillator, command: java Initial 80 80 10

where 80 is the number of cells horizontally and vertically (although I forgot which one is horizontal and which vertical),

10 is the size of each cell

My next task is to make the number of cells default - not based on user command.

For the Dart Oscillator, command: java Model 80 80 5 80

where 80 is the number of cells horizontally and vertically (although I forgot which one is horizontal and which vertical),

5 is the size of each cell

80 is the number of iterations (this is a good argument and I am gonna retain it)

My next task is to make the number of cells default - not based on user command.
