# Jammer_And_Dart
<p>Jammer Oscillator and Dart Glider</p>
<p>Main function is in Sim134.java</p>

<p>Tested using the commands:
  - java Sim134 300 R
  - java Sim134 80 J
  - java Sim134 200 D
</p>
<p> "R", "J" and "D" stand for "Random", "Jam" and "Dart" respectively. However you can put any other character just to see the kingdom of White Walkers (white cells - white walkers - dead - Game of Thrones - get it? anyone?). </p>
<p> main functions have been removed from Initial.java and Model.java </p>
